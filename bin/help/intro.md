# Introduction

[Beam Inspector](https://www.n2-photonics.de/beaminspector) is a standalone desktop application for calculation of beam sizes according the ISO 11146 method of variances. It can process a single monochrome image or a data stream from some types of industrial cameras.

Main features:

- Basic control of the camera exposure parameters (exposure time, analog & digital gain)
- [Laser beam width, position, and ellipticity measurements according to ISO 11146](./iso.md).
- [Background subtraction](./cam_settings_bgnd.md)
- [Area of interest selection](./cam_settings_roi.md)
- Laser beam parameter tracking for stability measurements
- Beam position reference overlay
- Analysis of static images
- Variable color maps
