# ISO 11146

ISO 11146 is intended to provide a simple, consistent way of describing the width of a beam.

## Total power

The total power <i>P</i> is obtained by integrating the irradiance <i>E(x,y)</i> over the entire beam

The center of the beam can be found by

## Beam center

## Variance

A useful parameter characterizing a general two-dimensional distribution <i>E(x,y)</i> is the variance in the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> directions

## Beam radius

For a Gaussian distribution centered at (0,0) with <i>1/e<sup>2</sup></i> radius <i>w</i> we find

![Beam radius](./img/eq_radius.png)

This leads to the definition of the beam radius adopted by ISO 11146

## Principal axes

Axes of the maximum and minimum beam extent based on the centered second order moments of the power density distribution in a cross section of the beam.

The <i>x</i>-axis diameter <i>d<sub>x</sub> = 2w<sub>x</sub></i> is given by

![Diameter X](./img/eq_dx.png)

The <i>y</i>-axis diameter <i>d<sub>y</sub> = 2w<sub>y</sub></i> is given by

![Diameter Y](./img/eq_dy.png)

## Tilt angle

This is measured as a positive angle counter-clockwise between the <i>x</i>-axis of the laboratory system and that of the principal axis of the power density distribution which is closer to the x-axis

![Tilt angle](./img/eq_tilt.png)

If the principal axes make the angle <i>Ï€/4</i> with the <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-axes of the laboratory coordinate system, then <i>d<sub>x</sub></i> is by convention the larger beam width.

## Ellipticity

Ratio between the minimum and maximum beam widths

![Ellipticity](./img/eq_ellipticity.png)

Circular power density distribution - power density distribution having an ellipticity greater than 0.87.

## Eccentricity
