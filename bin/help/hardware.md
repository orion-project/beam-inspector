## IDS

Currently, only [IDS](https://de.ids-imaging.com) cameras supporting the IDS peak software ([GenICam](https://www.emva.org/standards-technology/genicam)) are supported. The [IDS peak SDK](https://en.ids-imaging.com/ids-peak.html) has to be installed to make them working, see [Application Settings](./app_settings_ids.md) for how to configure.

The following cameras are tested:

- [IDS U3-3680XCP-NIR Rev.1.2](https://de.ids-imaging.com/store/u3-3680xcp-nir-rev-1-2.html) (recommended max. beam diameter: 2.8 mm @ 1/e²)
- [IDS U3-3180CP Rev. 2.2](https://de.ids-imaging.com/store/u3-3180cp-rev-2-2.html) (recommended max. beam diameter: 3.9 mm @ 1/e²)
