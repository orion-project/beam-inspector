# Calculations

This directory contains different calculation scripts and sample programs intended for testing numerical algorithms and performance comparison for choosing an optimal option.

It's preferable to use virtual environment for running Python scripts in order not to overload the global scope with unnecessary and probably conflicting dependencies.

Linux, macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Windows:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

There is no `python3` command on Windows so be sure Python 3 is in the `PATH`

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
